Fitting Distributions to Sparse Data Via Maximum Entropy

## ToDo
- Start with a basic toy example
- Get the data structures working
- Work on discrete data for now

## Coding
1. Feature/attribute selection into one module
2. Optimization/fitting part into another (which accpets 'important' features from part 1
