# Introduction

Fitting Distributions for Sparse Data Via Maximum Entropy.


# Things to do

- Get started with coding (python)

- Read reference papers

- Familiarize with the subject matter

- Think about extensions

# Coding

- Start with a basic toy example

- Get the data structures working

- Work on discrete data for now

- Search for appropriate Python packages


## Features 

1. Feature/attribute selection into one module

2. Optimization/fitting part into another (which accepts 'important' features from part 1)
